# Hi there, I'm theArchitectEngineer101 👋

### Building the bridge between Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence.

<br>

Mechanical Engineer who enjoys bridging the gap between hardware and software. I build tangible projects—from hardware prototypes to data-driven animations—that solve engineering challenges and explain complex mathematical concepts. My primary areas of interest and ongoing projects are in robotics, control systems, and applied machine learning.

### 🏗️ Featured Blueprints & Projects

These are the current pillars of my work. Some are proofs-of-concept, while others are the foundations for larger future projects.

#### Analyses & Visualizations
* **[Matlab_DataAnalysis](https://github.com/theArchitectEngineer101/Matlab_DataAnalysis):** Scripts for data analysis and systems simulation, including a didactic animation of the convolution process.
* **[Manim_EngineeringConcepts](https://github.com/theArchitectEngineer101/Manim_EngineeringConcepts):** Animations and visualizations of complex engineering and mathematical concepts, such as the surface of a Laplace transform.

#### Architectural Visions (Future Projects)
* **Project Ignis:** The vision for a 5-DOF robotic arm, from mechanical design to control firmware.
* **Protocol Chimera:** The evolution of Ignis, incorporating active perception (Computer Vision) and adaptive intelligence (Machine Learning).
* **Project Icarus:** A future exploration into kite aerodynamics using OpenFOAM simulations.
